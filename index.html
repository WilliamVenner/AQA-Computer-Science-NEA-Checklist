					This checklist calculates an upper-bound mark, lower-bound mark and median mark algorithmically for the AQA Computer Science NEA, and provides you with grades for each based on the 2018 mark scheme.

					<div class="spacer px20"></div>
					
					<ul>
						<li>For most marking criteria, you will need to <strong>manually select the band you believe you are achieving.</strong></li>
						<li>For other marking criteria, the band will be <strong>selected for you algorithmically based on what items you have checked.</strong></li>
						<li>For the "technical skills" marking criteria, you must <strong>manually select the band you believe you are achieving</strong>, but this will be moderated algorithmically based on what items you have checked.</li>
						<li>Your final marks are calculated using the percentage of progress you have achieved in a band or (for marking criteria that does not have progress percentages) the mark ranges/actual marks of your selected bands.</li>
						<li><strong>To manually select a band for a marking criteria</strong>, just click it (the leftmost column.)</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="spacer px20"></div>

					<strong>Note: </strong>These algorithms are designed to be fair and realistic, but you can never know what the examiner is actually going to award you with! This must be used as a guide ONLY and does not represent your actual marks or grade.
					<div class="spacer px5"></div>
					<strong>Note 2: </strong>The technical skills table provided by AQA is only a list of <i>examples</i> and extra marks could be awarded for additional technical skills that may not be listed.
